description: Opening the computer before deciding what to do is a dangerous thing. Decide first; then take tools out.

When working on something physical, one gets the tools out only when the thing to be done has been decided:

1. I decide to build a stool.
2. I get the saw out to cut some wood.

_Not_ the other way around. Getting the saw out just because, without prior decision, would be strange.

That is, however, what sometimes happens with the computer: it's a tool so versatile that it's tempting to open it _to decide_ what to work on. Before I notice, hours went by an I jumped from one (very interesting) piece of content to the next, half-learned some random bits of technical skills, and had a few scattered conversations, with little real progress to show in the projects that I actually care about.

So: decide what to do first, with minimal use of the computer. Only when (if!) the computer is needed, open it, close distractions, and focus on the task.

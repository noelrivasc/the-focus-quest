title: The energy sweet spot

Some days my energy level is low. My body would rather walk, watch birds, be chill.

Those days, it's hard to get started and to keep going, to do productive thinking. On those low energy days, easy pleasures like YouTube, food or other distractions are more tempting, hard to resist.

Other days, however, my energy level is very high. I'm thinking a million things; ideas overlapping and bubbling with possibilities.

Those days I want to do everything, fix everything, create a lot. Easy pleasures are easy to dismiss because I'm on a mission to do everything!

The problem, however, is that the excessive energy can be a distraction on its own. Instead of focusing on concrete actions and completing them, my brain wants to explore all the things we'll do, and how marvelous it will be!

Other days, however, the energy level is just right; it's in the sweet spot. I feel energetic but clear-focused. Planning, ideating and getting things done comes naturally.

That's the spot I'm usually chasing; trying to alter the focus and energy level with juggling, meditation, visualization and what not.

It feels good, being in the sweet spot.

Like today :)

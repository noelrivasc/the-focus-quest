Sometimes there's too much going on in my head.

When worries pile up or ideas become too exciting, it's as if someone steps on the gas pedal of thoughts, launching them on a frency.

If ideas are flowing fast it can be pleasant, invigorating. If it gets too intense or it's a negative train of thought, however, it just drains my energy â€”energy that I need to accomplish things and to have fun.

The best antidote I've found is physical activity. Some physical activity is compatible with overthinking, though.

So, when things get really crazy up there, it's time for the big guns: juggling.

Try to overthink while stepping on a balance board and attempting to juggle three balls!

I have better ideas when I'm away from the computer or notebook —when I walk, do pottery or do the dishes. The thing is that those ideas are often lost because I don't capture them immediately. I may find a solution to a problem —say, how to approach a conversation on the risks of an upcoming project— but if I don't capture it soon, it can vanish just as it appeared.

It seems to me that this leads not just to the loss of _that_ idea, but to losing the opportunity to connect it to other ideas and form more useful networks.

The thing is that, when I walk, I want to pay attention to my surroundings, smell the air, enjoy the stroll —not be on my phone taking notes.

The best solution I've found to capturing ideas quickly is the use of voice notes. There are apps but my favorite is a small Sony voice recorder. I just tap a couple of buttons (that I can _feel_ with my hands!) and it's in recording mode, ready to capture thoughts.

Highly recommended.

Uncontrolled overthinking sucks.

Solving problems feels nice: there's a small rush of satisfaction whenever I find a good conclusion. When my head goes full throttle and is unwilling to stop, however, that can be nasty.

A couple of years ago I was trying to figure out the best team structure in our small agency to serve clients who wanted a particular type of project. There were many angles to consider, so my brain was very active those days. All cool, except, at some point, I was *unable* to stop thinking about it.

I would go into the shower or whatever, and my inner dialog would still be going full speed, all the time.

It was exhausting â€”and unproductive.

So, what to do about it?

The best solution I've found is asymmetrical breathing (exhaling longer than it takes to inhale). I'll write about that in more detail soon!

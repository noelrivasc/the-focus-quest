Back in March I wrote about framing the pain that is felt during adaptation (when training the body or the mind) [not as pain but as "the effects of magic"](/career/misc/2024/03/26/freediving-lessons/). The idea is to turn a negative sensation into one that is perceived positively by thinking about it in a different way.

When the muscles burn during the last rep, it's not pain: it's the magic of the muscles that are about to grow.

When the ears ring, the mind exhausted after a study session it's not pain: it's the magic of learning doing its thing.

For the past year or so, I've felt waves of stress and discomfort in my (not-so) new job. At times, I've hated it and wanted to quit.

Some weeks ago, I was reflecting on the things I've learned on the course of the project I've been working on for the past six months. And, boy have I leaned! This year has been a constant drinking from the firehose in terms of learning new tools and technologies, learning how to work with a team, understanding our clients' needs, and a lot more.

It's time to eat my own magic dog food, it seems; maybe when it feels terrible it's not that it sucks: it's magic.

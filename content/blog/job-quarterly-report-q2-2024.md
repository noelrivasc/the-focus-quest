description: "An update to my job satisfaction report. Spoiler: stays pretty much the same."

Back in March, I did [my first job quarterly report](/2024/03/21/quarterly-report); this is an update for Q2.

I'll start with the results, and then leave notes on what changed.

|Dimension|Score|
|---------|--------|
|Money Surplus|63 / 100|
|Job Satisfaction|50 / 100|
|Skill Acquisition|70 / 100|
|Vitality Surplus|30 / 100|

**Total score: 213 out of 400**. A 18% improvement, all coming from money surplus.

## Money surplus

Formula: `((income - expenses) / expenses) * 100`

- Q1 value: 30.
- Q2 value: 63 .

While my income didn't change, my household situation changed. We now have two incomes, which allows for more substantial savings.

I got a substantial bonus that, if considered, would have bumped this value to 94 but I did not include it because it's not a reliable source of income.

## Job satisfaction

> What percentage of the time Iâ€™m at the job do I experience positive emotions?

- Q1 value: 50
- Q2 value: 50

This one remains about the same. There are highs and lows, and the reasons for (dis)satisfaction vary. 

At the core, there's a difference between the communication and project management styles that we operate on, versus the ones I would prefer. That's unlikely to go away.

## Skill acquisition

> How valuable was this period in terms of acquiring or honing useful skills?

- Q1 value: 70
- Q2 value: 70

I've been exposed to a _ton_ or technical concepts, and have learned a lot about cloud services, AWS in particular. I don't feel there's much progress in non-technical skills this quarter.

## Vitality surplus

> Compared to the vitality I invest in the job, how much do I have left to do whatever I want with it?

- Q1 value: 30
- Q2 value: 30

I was on vacation for three weeks; not counting those here.

The job is taking big chunks of emotional energy. I can't say that I have too much work assigned, but I'm finding it hard to complete work efficiently and move on to other things, which is impacting how much I can do outside work.

## Additional notes

Job satisfaction is a combination between what the job offers, and what one does with that. I realize that, while my job has its downsides, there are actions I can take to ameliorate them and grow.

This quarter, I started meditating during working hours, as a means to quiet the mental noise, and focus on the task at hand. It's been helpful to become more effective.

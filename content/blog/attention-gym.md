It seems that the antidote to distraction is training one's attention.

This week I realized that it's about _training_, not about wanting to magically be able to focus against all distractions.

My neighbors have a new dog, and it barks. A lot. But, some days like, A LOT.

I get not only distracted but angry. My mind turns into a super sensitive bark detector and even with headphones on, I hear the dog. I hate it.

Last week I tried to force myself to concentrate but in the end I gave up and went out to work on a coffee shop.

Ignoring a barking dog is beyond my reach; my focus is not nearly strong enough. I have to _train_ for that.

There was something wrong with my body this morning. I had some pain and zero desire to sit in front of the screen, so it was time for a long walk.

I canceled the only meeting on the calendar, packed my journal and voice recorder, and went to a cafe that serves amazing breakfast and happens to be 5km from my place —about an hour walking.

During breakfast, I listened to voice notes from the past month, took notes on my journal and enjoyed watching the work at the bakery.

After breakfast, another 20 minute walk took me to a store to buy the grey ink for a the grey Kaweco pen that I use on my journal —months went by since the last drop, and I missed it.

By then it was too sunny and too late to walk an hour an a half back home. I took an Uber.

Once home, I sat at the computer, resolved and reinvigorated. 

In the next three hours or so I accomplished more than on some long days: I wrote code to finish a Zendesk integration, got to set up the local environment with Docker and reviewed a coleague's notes on some app's messaging requirements.

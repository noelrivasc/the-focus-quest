Last year, my right hand started hurting. I'd wake up with a trigger thumb, and some days the base of my thumb would feel sore.

For some time, I had believed that the problem was related to the [Kensington _Expert Mouse_ trackball](https://store.kensington.com/collections/1-trackballs/products/kensington-expert-trackball-mouse-k64325) I was using, and _how_ I was using it: the thing was configured with the left click on the top-right button, and the right click on the bottom-right one.

I configured the trackball that way to use my thumb less, but the configuration made things worse: instead of just clicking with my thumb (a simple movement), I was moving the ball with it, which was much more frequent and used a bigger range of movements.

Recently, the pain got worse so I decided to try the Apple trackpad; one week later, the pain and trigger thumb are gone.

I'm finding it easier to concentrate and work feels more pleasant. 

Thinking, walking, pointing, scrolling... it's just one body doing it all.

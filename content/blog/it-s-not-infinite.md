I had a great day at work today. 

During the previous days, I did all the analysis and setting things up to write a module in the system I'm working on. Today, the preparation bore fruit: the path forward was clear enough that fingers flew over the keyboard, laying line after line of code without strain. It felt great.

This went on for about four hours, but then, my eyes found themselves pointing at YouTube.

I tried pulling them back to the editor but they soon found something else to rest on. About to make the mistake of forcing them back to the colorful lines of text, I realized that I was just tired; it was time to stop â€”or at least, rest.

Even when focus is shining, it's not infinite.

Eventually, it's time to call it a day.

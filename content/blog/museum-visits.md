I went to the museum today. Man, I really like that experience.

I don't mean the famous museums and great works of art; just visiting a local place and seeing a few interesting pieces. I didn't like some of the stuff I saw today, but that's not relevant.

What I found to be relevant is that going to those places exposes me to new ideas, some of which I may not like, but that still trigger thoughts.

Sitting in front of the computer (or paper or other medium) and doing the work (writing, programming, throwing a ceramic pot...) is essential to do creative work; but putting myself in situations that stimulate thought is good fuel for creativity.

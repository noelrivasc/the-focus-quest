It may be dumb, but I just realized this: the lighting at my home office sucks.

There is a ceiling lamp that casts shadows over whatever is on the desk, which usually is a handful of half-letter sheets of paper with my notes on the day's work and various projects.

The other lamp (there's only two) is a light bar over the monitor, which is ok for lighting my work but doesn't provide any ambient light.

A quick scan revealed some studies that conclude that illumination affects concentration in students. Students are easy to test since they are together in a room already, but I don't see why this wouldn't apply to software developers or other knowledge workers.

So, my next step in improving the built environment for better, more pleasant work: get better lighting!

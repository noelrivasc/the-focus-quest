## What about Attention?

Sometimes, after a long day at work or when there are too many things going on, I end up experiencing what I call the "zombie state". It's characterized by:

- Grumpiness
- Feeling drained
- Increased tinnitus
- Cognitive skills are shot

A few days back I found the term [Directed Attention Fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_attention_fatigue). *That's it!*

Pulling on the thread through Google Scholar, I discovered research on the topic going back to the 90's, and that there is research on the treatment, or restoration, of attention.

This is exciting! Combating the *zombie state* is a good chunk of the motivation that started this blog.

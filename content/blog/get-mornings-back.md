[A few days ago](/2024/07/10/a-good-morning-walk/) I started the day different than others: with a very long walk. My body forced the decision but since then I've been thinking about how much I miss mornings.

Before, when I worked on my own, many times I went out early to walk, have breakfast and coffee, and read or work on something that required thinking and looking at the horizon. I miss those days; I miss the kind of deep thinking that I can afford between sips of a good machiatto.

As contrast, now, I kick off most days with the daily standup. After that, more meetings may follow, or I'll start hacking on the tickets assigned to me. Sometimes, if there's too much to do or the day turns out to be confusing or inefficient, I don't get out of the house the whole day.

Perhaps for other people the idea of the hacker who works day and night in the dark, without interests beyond what's in their monitor is alluring. For me, it's not: I like fresh air and greeting people in my neighborhood.

I want to do the best work I'm capable of; for that, I need varied stimuli.

This is the plan: I'll try to take at least a few hours every Wednesday to start the day a bit later, after a long walk and good coffee. I think it'll be good for my mood, my body and my work.

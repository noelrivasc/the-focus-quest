# About

I'm Noel. I write about software development, wild critters found in the digital realm, and surrounding phenomena.

This blog started as _The Focus Quest_: an exploration to find ways to make work more pleasant, do it in less time, and enjoy life more. A stream of notes exploring distraction, attention and intention, and how that all plays with knowledge work â€”software development in particular.

I later decided to treat it as a general blog, of which the focus quest is a section.
